
﻿The following coding challenge has been giving by Michael Leutelt, one of the founders of IT Active Recruitment with the final goal to learn new way of coding alternative and real apps, apply what we've learn during this intensive web development course, and also to be available to do our Final Project and Intership with this interesting company that its giving us the change to be part of.

To start with, we need to use a Full Stack Mern, in this case, react, mongoose and express with the facility to implement the design we would prefer, and in this case i would like to use Bootstrap react, Css, as for the time that we have to, only three days, is what give me the major advantage to procedure to develope a responsive App.

Here i would like to give the exact task that has been giving to use, and in my first impression and with my knowloadge i would to put a high imput to Deploy my app in firebase, as in something we have not learn till now, but at the same time give me a huge reason to focus on getting my Data in my Mongoose as well.

Lets have fun together in this Journey that i will be telling to you, also, if you want to ask me something do not hesistate! Here we go!

(21-05-2021..17:38 friday afternoon in Berlin : )
(24-05-2021...21:49 monday night, finishing this long journy but also one that brought me many new important learning on my new path career live)


Here is my approach: 

1.- needed to implement CRUD full this time full merm app, which in this case with also using a frontend like React made me think if i should apply context API, redux, or just try to simplify my App in the just short days that i had.

2-this is how my website was looking first day after fetching data to data base and beeing available to get finally some data behind the front!

3.- Fetching data and then getting it was not complicate, but after trying to apply context API and see that i had no much more time, made me to change my plan and this time use just simple renders between components, making my speed better and also to see the effects.

4.- updating my card, but also my data base made my thing and realize that the first approach that i have issue and wanted to implements was not possible, so i decided to change my JSON and how i was sending the data ( appending each input ).

5.- After beeing available to update and see that time was runing low, i could not finish the last task adding different values, but is half way to get it.

6.- Lack of experience on deploying my app with Heroku, made me spend a lot of time finding the way to actually deploy two different folders and connecting them between. Deploying with Heroku was not dificult, but due some app errors that i was having due NPM, NODE, npm run BUILD and some other problems. I've found a solution to just clone my app again from Github, letting me start somehow from 0 and beeing available to push my backend to my website server.

7.- Even though my app was working perfect from my own server, after deploying react ( happened before, dont know the reason ) the links were not working properly and the gh page was not working as how i wanted. 

Conclusion: 

Planing, thinking and studying at the same time, in only 4 days to create this Coding Challenge, has giving me the tools to create and develope a nice app from scratch wich i feel happy with. NodeJs with the mix of an amazing FrameWork as React, can give you the facility to bring a online app on and easy way and with the speed and facility that i needed for this Project. Heroku has a great deploying system to bring your MongoDB data online and use it wherever and whenever you wants. 

Thanks for this experience to It Active Challenge, and i hope your team is happy with what i've develope.

Thanks,

The task:

1-"Create a grocery shopping list. You can add items in the frontend. This data is stored in the backend. The list shows the items. You can create new items, you can delete items and you can modify items. So, if you want to change "tomaeteos" (misspelled) to "tomatoes", you can. All updated are stored in backend."

2-Bonus task: (if you really want to impress)
We are using google firebase to bring code alive. It would be a great advantage, if you are able to deploy the code to firebase, so that I can test your grocery shopping application directly online. While I test the app in the frontend, our developers will inspect your code in the backend. You don't necessarily have to deploy on firebase, just deploy somewhere so that I can test the application without seeing the code.

3-Bonus task for professionals:
"Add a priority number to each item on the list, for example between 1 and 5 (1 is the highest priority), and the priority items appear first on the list, but after they are checked as done (or already bought) they will go to the bottom of the list. If I for example want to point out that onions are quite important, I would give the onions a 2 so that they are directly displayed below all the items with a 1."
