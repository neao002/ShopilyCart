
The following coding challenge has been giving by Michael Leutelt, one of the founders of IT Active Recruitment with the final goal to learn a new way of coding alternative and real apps, apply what we've learned during this intensive web development course, and also to be available to do our Final Project and Internship with this interesting company that it's giving us the change to be part of.

To start with, we need to use a Full Stack Mern, in this case, react, mongoose, and express with the facility to implement the design we would prefer, and in this case, I would like to use Bootstrap react, CSS, as for the time that we have to, only three days, is what gives me the major advantage to the procedure to develop a responsive App.

Here I would like to give the exact task that has been giving to use, and in my first impression and with my knowledge I would put a high input to Deploy my app in firebase, as in something we have not to learn till now, but at the same time give me a huge reason to focus on getting my Data in my Mongoose as well.

Let us have fun together on this journey that I will be telling you, also, if you want to ask me something do not hesitate! Here we go!

(24-05-2021... 21:49 p.m. Monday, finishing this long journey but also one that brought me much new important learning on my new path career life)


Here is my approach: 

1.- needed to implement CRUD full this time full merm app, which in this case with also using a frontend like React made me think if I should apply context API, redux, or just try to simplify my App in the just short days that I had.

2-this is how my website was looking the first day after fetching data to the database and being available to get finally some data behind the front!

3.- Fetching data and then getting it was not complicated, but after trying to apply context API and see that I had no much more time, made me change my plan and this time use just simple renders between components, making my speed better and also to see the effects.

4.- updating my card, but also my database made me think and realize that the first approach that I have an issue with and wanted to implements were not possible, so I decided to change my JSON and how I was sending the data ( appending each input ).

5.- After being available to update and see that time was running low, I could not finish the last task adding different values, but is halfway to get it.

6.- Lack of experience in deploying my app with Heroku, made me spend a lot of time finding the way to actually deploy two different folders and connecting them between. Deploying with Heroku was not difficult, but due to some app errors that I was having due to NPM, NODE, npm run BUILD, and some other problems. I've found a solution to just clone my app again from Github, letting me start somehow from 0 and being available to push my backend to my website server.

7.- Even though my app was working perfect from my own server, after deploying react ( happened before, dont know the reason ) the links were not working properly and the gh page was not working as how i wanted. 


Resume:
Planning, thinking, and studying at the same time, in only 4 days to create this Coding Challenge, has given me the tools to create and develop a nice app from scratch which I feel happy with. NodeJs with the mix of an amazing FrameWork as React can give you the facility to bring an online app in an easy way and with the speed and facility that I needed for this Project. Heroku has a great deploying system to bring your MongoDB data online and use it wherever and whenever you want.

Thanks for this experience to Active It Recruitment, and i hope your team is happy with what i've develope.

Thanks,

The task:

1-"Create a grocery shopping list. You can add items in the frontend. This data is stored in the backend. The list shows the items. You can create new items, you can delete items and you can modify items. So, if you want to change "tomaeteos" (misspelled) to "tomatoes", you can. All updated are stored in backend."

2-Bonus task: (if you really want to impress)
We are using google firebase to bring code alive. It would be a great advantage, if you are able to deploy the code to firebase, so that I can test your grocery shopping application directly online. While I test the app in the frontend, our developers will inspect your code in the backend. You don't necessarily have to deploy on firebase, just deploy somewhere so that I can test the application without seeing the code.

3-Bonus task for professionals:
"Add a priority number to each item on the list, for example between 1 and 5 (1 is the highest priority), and the priority items appear first on the list, but after they are checked as done (or already bought) they will go to the bottom of the list. If I for example want to point out that onions are quite important, I would give the onions a 2 so that they are directly displayed below all the items with a 1."
