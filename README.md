The following coding challenge has been giving by Michael Leutelt, one of the founders of IT Active Recruitment with the final goal to learn new way of coding alternative and real apps, apply what we've learn during this intensive web development course, and also to be available to do our Final Project and Intership with this interesting company that its giving us the change to be part of.

To start with, we need to use a Full Stack Mern, in this case, react, mongoose and express with the facility to implement the design we would prefer, and in this case i would like to use Bootstrap react, Css, as for the time that we have to, only three days, is what give me the major advantage to procedure to develope a responsive App.

Here i would like to give the exact task that has been giving to use, and in my first impression and with my knowloadge i would to put a high imput to Deploy my app in firebase, as in something we have not learn till now, but at the same time give me a huge reason to focus on getting my Data in my Mongoose as well.

Lets have fun together in this Journey that i will be telling to you, also, if you want to ask me something do not hesistate! Here we go!

22:52, finishig first day after 5 days of coding without any break :), It was not Easy to apply CRUD with the mix of data base, also, update part is not still possible and i need to find a solution tomorrow. I was proud to be available to connect my Client to my DataBase, also upload photos and recieve the information of my grocery Shop. Tomorrow will be a new day full of new task's but i could make it for sure.

The task:

1-"Create a grocery shopping list. You can add items in the frontend. This data is stored in the backend. The list shows the items. You can create new items, you can delete items and you can modify items. So, if you want to change "tomaeteos" (misspelled) to "tomatoes", you can. All updated are stored in backend."

2-Bonus task: (if you really want to impress)
We are using google firebase to bring code alive. It would be a great advantage, if you are able to deploy the code to firebase, so that I can test your grocery shopping application directly online. While I test the app in the frontend, our developers will inspect your code in the backend. You don't necessarily have to deploy on firebase, just deploy somewhere so that I can test the application without seeing the code.

3-Bonus task for professionals:
"Add a priority number to each item on the list, for example between 1 and 5 (1 is the highest priority), and the priority items appear first on the list, but after they are checked as done (or already bought) they will go to the bottom of the list. If I for example want to point out that onions are quite important, I would give the onions a 2 so that they are directly displayed below all the items with a 1."
